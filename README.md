As Sweden continues its transition to renewable energy, electrical prices are a hot topic of conversation. Recently, we decided to take a closer look at these prices by analyzing, then visualizing them in Tableau.

What we found was quite interesting. As you can see in the graph below, the average price of electricity in Sweden has been steadily rising over the past few years.

There are a number of factors contributing to this trend, including the increasing costs of renewable energy infrastructure and the closure of nuclear power plants. However, it's important to note that Sweden still has some of the lowest electrical prices in Europe (ec.europa.eu).

At the same time, the country is making significant strides towards a more sustainable energy future. In 2020, Sweden generated nearly 50% of its electricity from renewable sources, and the government has set a goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2040.
